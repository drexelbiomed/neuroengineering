    We study how animal behavior emerges from the complex interaction amongst the animal's nervous systems, their muscle-body dynamics and their environment.
    We use fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) as our model organism because they perform many complex behaviors with a relatively simple brain, and because of the many genetic tools that are available in the flies.
    We employ a multi-pronged approach which includes in vivo whole-cell patch clamp recordings, imaging, quantitative measurement of behavior, biomechanics, and computation.

    Our laboratory focuses on basic mechanisms of motor control in spinal cord, and on corticospinal interactions. The focus particularly on spinal cord modularity in relation to these.
