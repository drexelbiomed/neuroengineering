    We study how animal behavior emerges from the complex interaction amongst the animal's nervous systems, their muscle-body dynamics and their environment.
    We use fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) as our model organism because they perform many complex behaviors with a relatively simple brain, and because of the many genetic tools that are available in the flies.
    We employ a multi-pronged approach which includes in vivo whole-cell patch clamp recordings, imaging, quantitative measurement of behavior, biomechanics, and computation.

    Our research interests are mainly in the areas of human and translational neuroengineering. In human neuroenginering, we particularly focus on the integration of neurophysiological sensors, such as functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), electroencephalogram (EEG), and also eye-tracking for personalized training in safety critical tasks; brain-in-the-loop studies to improve human autonomy teaming and training both in clinical (nurse, surgeon training) and in aviation (autonomous systems); and effects of immersive technologies, such as virtual reality (VR) manipulative interventions on learning. In translational neuroengineering,  our laboratory primarily focuses on sensor and algorithm development for anesthesia, sedation monitoring; point-of-care monitoring in prolonged field care including cerebral edema and local tissue oximetry; blood flow measures for hemorrhage assessment and management; and study of biomarkers for the traumatic brain injury.

    Dr. Liang's research is focused on neural data science, machine learning, and biomedical natural language processing. The lab uses data science to advance a broad range of topics, including 1) causal discovery in big neuroscience data (spikes, LFP, EEG/MEG and fMRI), 2) machine learning for brain age prediction via integrating genetic, neuroimaging, and clinical data, and 3) deep learning for biomedical text mining, drug labeling review and drug discovery.

    We investigate neural circuits that underlie sensorimotor transformations. We employ and develop novel tools that enable us to reengineer these circuits to understand how they function at the molecular to network level, and to understand the developmental processes that lead to their organization.

    Our laboratory studies the operation of the neural circuits controlling locomotion. Specifically, we are interested in understanding the connectivity and function of the spinal circuits, how they integrate feedback from somatosensory afferents and commands from supraspinal centers, and how their operation is changed after motor disorders (such as spinal cord injury). We employ computational methods (neural network and musculoskeletal modeling) and work in close collaboration with experimentalists. These computational techniques provide us with excellent tools to investigate dynamic interactions between the different components of the locomotor system and allow us to incorporate a wealth of experimental findings into cohesive, integrated models that can then be used to derive hypotheses and guide future experiments.
