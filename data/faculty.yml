    We study how animal behavior emerges from the complex interaction amongst the animal's nervous systems, their muscle-body dynamics and their environment.
    We use fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) as our model organism because they perform many complex behaviors with a relatively simple brain, and because of the many genetic tools that are available in the flies.
    We employ a multi-pronged approach which includes in vivo whole-cell patch clamp recordings, imaging, quantitative measurement of behavior, biomechanics, and computation.
  areas: 
    - Sensorimotor integration
    - whole-cell patch clamp and imaging in behaving animals
    - optogenetics
    - neuromechanics
    - locomotion
