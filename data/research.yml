- topic: Systems Neuroengineering
  desc: Superficially, it might appear that different brain regions are important for different tasks. In reality, different regions in the brain are densely connected through neuronal pathways. Systems Neuroengineering is aimed at understanding the inner workings of the brain at a systems level or whole-brain level through a variety of state-of-the-art experimental and computational techniques.

- topic: Brain-computer interface
  desc: Research in Brain-computer interface or BCI is aimed at reading signals from the brain through a variety of methods such as surface or implanted electrodes and connects it to a device to carry out a desired action. BCI is a promising solution for many conditions in which the brain is intact but either the connection between brain and body is damaged through accident or neurodegeneration or the musculo-skeletal system is affected.

- topic: Neuroergonomics
  desc: Neuroergonomics research aims to understand the brain in everyday life contexts, and its relationship to action, behavior, body, and environment. Neuroergonomics research utilizes wearable and noninvasive neuroimaging and neurostimulation to expand our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying human perceptual, cognitive, and motor functioning with a focus on real-world contexts. Within the last decade, this emerging discipline has demonstrated potential to advances our understanding of brain with practical applications in diverse sectors such as medicine, education/training, aviation, automotive, manufacturing, administration, entertainment, communication and everyday life at large. Neuroergonomics research span from theoretical, and computational to applied and translational focusing on real-world industry challenges with implications in diverse sectors such as healthcare, education, transportation, manufacturing, entertainment, communication, and everyday life at large.

- topic: Translational neuroengineering
  desc: Translational neuroengineering is concerned with specific disease processes and therapies and the path from basic science and engineering to clinical application. The long term goals are clinically relevant devices and therapies. The research itself can be animal model based, or foundational engineering, or more direct pre-clinical testing processes, but the focus is to move knowledge and technology along the pipeline to clinic.

- topic: Human Neuroengineering
  desc: Human Neuroengineering ranges from clinical applications to recreational interface devices for games. At Drexel it is generally non-invasive, utilizing FNIR, EEG and other tools. In some instances at Drexel data collected invasively in clinical settings such as during neurosurgery or pre-operative testing may be the focus, but most work is less so.

- topic: Neuromechanics
  desc: Neuromechanics investigates the neural control and co-adaptations of  neural and biomechanics systems throughout motor systems. Neuromechanics topics can range from the human gait lab to the swimming of fish, frog protective reflexes, or the walking and evasion manoevres of fruit flies. The field is a marriage of mechanics and neural control principles and draws from both, interfacing closely with neural circuit analyses.
