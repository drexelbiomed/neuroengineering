    We study how animal behavior emerges from the complex interaction amongst the animal's nervous systems, their muscle-body dynamics and their environment.
    We use fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) as our model organism because they perform many complex behaviors with a relatively simple brain, and because of the many genetic tools that are available in the flies.
    We employ a multi-pronged approach which includes in vivo whole-cell patch clamp recordings, imaging, quantitative measurement of behavior, biomechanics, and computation.

    Our laboratory focuses on basic mechanisms of motor control in spinal cord, in cortex, and on corticospinal interactions. The focus of our work is particularly on spinal cord modularity in relation to these, and the idea of motor primitives and muscle synergies as building block for functional movements. In addition, we are interested in the role of trunk control and its integration with the limbs, both in normal movement and during recovery from Spinal Cord Injury (SCI), and interested in combinations of bionic and biological and robotic therapies to promote recovery following SCI. Finally, our work involves the design and development of new neurotechnologies for recording and stimulation, especially in spinal cord, and the translation of these as viable Intellectual Property and useful devices.

    Our research interests are mainly in the areas of human and translational neuroengineering. In human neuroenginering, we particularly focus on the integration of neurophysiological sensors, such as functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), electroencephalogram (EEG), and also eye-tracking for personalized training in safety critical tasks; brain-in-the-loop studies to improve human autonomy teaming and training both in clinical (nurse, surgeon training) and in aviation (autonomous systems); and effects of immersive technologies, such as virtual reality (VR) manipulative interventions on learning. In translational neuroengineering,  our laboratory primarily focuses on sensor and algorithm development for anesthesia, sedation monitoring; point-of-care monitoring in prolonged field care including cerebral edema and local tissue oximetry; blood flow measures for hemorrhage assessment and management; and study of biomarkers for the traumatic brain injury.

    Our laboratory studies the operation of the neural circuits controlling locomotion. Specifically, we are interested in understanding the connectivity and function of the spinal circuits, how they integrate feedback from somatosensory afferents and commands from supraspinal centers, and how their operation is changed after motor disorders (such as spinal cord injury). We employ computational methods (neural network and musculoskeletal modeling) and work in close collaboration with experimentalists. These computational techniques provide us with excellent tools to investigate dynamic interactions between the different components of the locomotor system and allow us to incorporate a wealth of experimental findings into cohesive, integrated models that can then be used to derive hypotheses and guide future experiments.

    We are exploring AI frameworks that mimic how the mammalian brain senses and understands the world. Our goal is to develop an AI system will learn much like an infant learns, by simply observing the world and learning through observation. Eventually, the model should learn the structure of the world and existing associations, and accurately make predictions. We are using neuromorphic software and hardware concepts such as sparse coding, top-down feedback, spiking neural networks, and neuronal dynamics to create a machine intelligence that has a better understanding of the world in which we live.

His research focuses on Machine Learning and Computer Architecture. The DISCO lab uses Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to implement biomedical and computer vision applications, which are mapped onto VLSI implementation of the central nervous system, also known as neuromorphic computing. The DISCO lab is currently exploring material characteristics of chalcogenide alloys to implement spiking neurons and bio-inspired learning rules for energy-efficient and reliable neuromorphic computing.

    At the intersection of cognitive neuroscience, neuropsychology, and neuroengineering, the Cognitive Neuroengineering and Wellbeing (CogNeW) laboratory examines how to use neural control to improve cognition. Using network neuroscience techniques, we focus on individual differences in brain-behavior relationships and responses to brain stimulation using anatomical and functional imaging in health and neurological diseases. We also have interests in the fast-emerging developments in neuromodulation and ethical quandries that they can induce. Accordingly, we study the psychology of neuroethical decision making in the public, patients, and clinicians to conduct policy-related research.
