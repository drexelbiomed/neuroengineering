    We study neural circuit dynamics underlying memory formation, with a focus on hippocampus associated circuitry. Our research employs a multidisciplinary approach, including optogenetics, multi-channel electrophysiology, calcium imaging, closed-loop control, and machine learning.

    Dr. España’s research focuses on the neural circuits underlying motivated behavior and the interface between arousal state and effortful responding for natural and drug rewards. Experimental techniques include electrophysiology, optogenetics, chemogenetics, fast scan cyclic voltammetry and a variety of modern genetic tools to interrogate the mechanisms underlying behavior. Evolving projects are focused on closed-loop approaches to query arousal state using electrophysiology so as to guide activation or inhibition of pathways of interest to alter motivation for rewards. Although much of the research surrounds dopaminergic pathways and mechanisms that support substance abuse, discoveries in the laboratory extend to other transmitters systems, pathways and behaviors.

    The Côté lab laboratory focuses on fostering motor control after spinal cord injury, with a focus on rehabilitative strategies and the underlying mechanisms at play. Our research uses a multidisciplinary approach to reengineer motor pathways after injury and probe their function, including motor training, kinematics and biomechanics, spinal cord stimulation, and other state-of-the-art techniques in electrophysiology.

    The goals of the work in our lab are to reveal the functional connectivity of spinal circuits involved in orchestrating locomotion and to determine how these circuits go awry in injury and disease states. Our current focuses are on mechanisms of locomotor rhythm generation and plasticity following both spinal cord injury and potential treatments for restoration of motor function.

    We study how injury and rehabilitative exercise modulates pain and sensorimotor function following spinal cord injury. We use a multidisciplinary approach which includes assessments of animal behavior, kinematics and electrophysiology as well as assessments of molecular changes in neuron and immune cell phenotypes.
