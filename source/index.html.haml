%h2 What is Neuroengineering?  
%p.big-text 
  Neuroengineering is a highly interdisciplinary endeavor aimed at understanding computations within the brain and the processes controlled by these computations, and then leveraging this understanding for a multitude of industrial and medical applications. Neuroengineering draws on expertise from many disciplines including neuroscience, mathematics, physics, biomedical engineering and computer sciences.

  %strong Drexel Neuroengineering
  is a cross-campus effort, spearheaded by the School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems and Drexel University College of Medicine, to educate the next generation of interdisciplinary brain scientists and bioengineers, by creating teams of students with a shared common language and similar quantitative bases and frameworks, even though each one originates from different original disciplines of expertise.
