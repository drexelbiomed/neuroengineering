%h2 What is Neuroengineering?  
.big-text
  %p.big-text 
    Neuroengineering is a highly interdisciplinary endeavor aimed at understanding computations within the brain and the processes controlled by these computations, and then leveraging this understanding for a multitude of industrial and medical applications. Neuroengineering draws on expertise from many disciplines including neuroscience, mathematics, physics, biomedical engineering and computer sciences.

    %strong Drexel Neuroengineering
    is a cross-campus effort, spearheaded by the Drexel University 
    = link_to "School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems", "https://drexel.edu/biomed" 
    and 
    = link_to "College of Medicine", "https://drexel.edu/medicine" 
    , to educate the next generation of interdisciplinary brain scientists and bioengineers, by creating teams of students with a shared common language and similar quantitative bases and frameworks, even though each one originates from different original disciplines of expertise.

  %strong Is Neuroengineering for you? 
  Neuroengineering is an effective launching pad for many careers such as an academic career in a wide variety of disciplines; and careers in industry such as robotics, prosthetics, brain-machine interfaces and machine learning. Neuroengineering is for anyone who is interested in understanding how brains work and the multi-faceted applications this understanding brings.

%p.big-text
  %strong How to prepare for a graduate education in Neuroengineering? 
  The ideal candidate will have: 
  %br
  1) strong quantitative training through coursework in mathematics and computer sciences, 
  %br
  2) some exposure to engineering, and 
  %br
  3) some exposure to neuroscience. 

%p.big-text
  However, since Neuroengineering is highly interdisciplinary, a grounding in many different STEM disciplines is a good starting point for Neuroengineering.
